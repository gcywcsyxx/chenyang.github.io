### 1.The more important your cheese is to you the more you want to hold on to it.

#### Response#1：What does this section say?
As the mice and little people enjoyed their cheese day by day, the quantity of it was gradually declining.However,they take different actions while constantly consuming the cheese.
The two people, on the one hand, took it for granted that they deserved the cheese and this arrogance made them become dependent on the cheese. On the other hand, the two mice still kept their habit and kept track of the change as time goes.

Finally, the worst thing came that one day, the cheese vanished. as Sniff and Scurry were aware of the fact that the cheese was getting smaller, they were not surprised at all and began their journey to search new cheese in the maze, in a way that is primitive and wild.
On the contrary, for Haw and Hem, this news is devastating. Both of them are very sad and anxious. Haw is unable to believe this. As for him, the cheese stands for safety and comfort. Hem become out of control and begin yelling, as the cheese means power to him.

#### Response#2:What does this section mean for me?
In my opinion, the cheese can be resource that you treasure or need. However, these resources are not evitable and forever last. For consumer goods, when we enjoy them, they are fewer; for the resources and property you control, you may lose them because of some uncontrollable factors. This requires us to be prepared in time of safety, to deal with all unexpected or doomed things. 
On the macro level, this epidemic is a good example. We can't communicate with foreign teachers face-to-face. We can only communicate through Tencent meetings. Some business owners are bankrupt because they have no orders. This requires these companies to keep a healthy balance sheet before the epidemic. As for my own experience, I once got IELTS 7.5 in high school, which is a very high score, and the level is basically equivalent to that of native English speakers. However, this result will be invalid in December this year for the certificate can only last for two years. At the same time, my English level is also declining, which requires me to practice English. On the one hand, I need to develop new advantages for myself and learn more things on the other hand. It's a painful process because I have to repeat what I used to be very good at, but I have no other choice. In short, it is very important to be alert to danger in times of safety. We need to consider the possible risks in our comfort and be prepared in advance.
