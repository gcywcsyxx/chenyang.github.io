### Welcome to My blog

#### This blog is my personal blog based on github. Below are my book review articles of the book <<Who Moved My Cheese>>.

### The main idea for the section
##### Old beliefs do not lead you to new cheese.

##### When you see that you can find and enjoy new cheese, you change course.



### My personal story with regard to them
##### 1. Old beliefs do not lead you to new cheese.

This section reminds me of an old Chinese saying: the old does not go, the new does not come. Roughly speaking, the death of an old thing can facilitate the arrival of something new. Rather than taking it literally, I think on a deeper level, the key is not the existence or disappearance of the thing itself, but the psychological impact it has on you, including your view of the past and your expectation of the future. It's no use crying over spilt milk. At such times, the most effective and constructive thing we can do is to move on and not let what is missing become a psychological burden.

In addition, it is worth noting that we human beings live in a highly competitive society with extremely limited resources, just like the earth is round. So time is as important as money, and efficiency is as important as life. In the book, Haw's indecision and psychological burden led him to the station where others had arrived. It was just like we failed to have insight into a trend of the industry in the society and thus fell behind our competitors. Because of the winner-take-all situation caused by Matthew effect, we could hardly get rich returns. This requires us to avoid all emotional interference, be the fastest runner.
"The quicker you let go of old cheese, The sooner you find new cheese." And I like to change that to "The quicker you let go of imagination, The bigger Success you can achieve."

##### 2. When you see that you can find and enjoy new cheese, you change course.


I found a very magical phenomenon, each section can recall a sentence in my mind, most of which are traditional Chinese proverbs I have recited before, and this section is no exception. This makes me deeply feel the breadth and profundity of Chinese traditional culture, the profound thinking of our ancestors on philosophy of life and the understanding of the unity of the world, because they originated from the literary works of two different countries, but actually produced the same essence. This section reminds me of the traditional Chinese saying: "Do your best and listen to the destiny".
It means that when things are not something we can decide, the best thing to do is to do our best and let God decide the final result. This is probably the general idea of this section.

But I want to talk about something else, it's about psychology. In the article, although haw misses hem very much, he also feels the joy of overcoming his fear. I think the source of his happiness lies in his actions. Most of the time, it is not to say that we will feel happy and happy after we have made great achievements, because after knowing the achievements, our happiness will decrease, because there is no new stimulus coming. However, haw is not happy when he finally finds big cheese, but in the process of hard working and in the process of constantly looking for continuous progress. This happiness is sustainable, endless and steady. This happiness is even increasing, because as he finds small pieces of cheese, he is constantly getting positive feedback, and his self-confidence will grow stronger and stronger until he finds big cheese.

On the contrary, hem doesn't accept the cheese brought by haw, and he still thinks about the old cheese. In the process, he doesn't act, so he feels helpless, desperate and painful. In this case, it is better to act than to wait. Search in the maze corresponds to action, while remaining at the cheese station corresponds to staying still. Some people may say that there is danger in action, but it is safe to stay where you are without cheese to eat. But think carefully, if you stay in the same place all the time, I think they will starve to death or be afraid to die before they encounter the imaginary danger, and the imaginary danger even doesn't exist. How can you know if you don't try?
From the above discussion, we can understand why continuous action is even safer than staying still.
This is just like we are growing up step by step, from primary school to junior high school, to senior high school, and finally to university. This step by step seems to be full of risks and challenges, but we can't stop because it is more dangerous. You see, today, we have made great achievements after overcoming numerous small difficulties.
