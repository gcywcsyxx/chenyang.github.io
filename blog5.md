This section mainly describes the psychological process of Haw. First, Haw realized the positive effect of fear on him. Then he summoned up his courage, walked out of his comfort zone, and then walked into the maze he had never entered before. Fortunately, through hard work, he found cheese in the next few days. But unfortunately, there is not much cheese and he needs to keep looking for more. In this process, he looked back on the past, gradually realized his previous mistakes, and grew up psychologically. He realized that he needed to smile the cheese often so he can know when it is getting old. Finally, he wrote down the sentence on the wall.
### 2.My personal story with regard to "Smell the Cheese Often So You Know When It Is Getting Old"
In fact, this sentence has a metaphorical meaning. Its hidden meaning is that we need to pay attention to and keep track of the situation we are facing, such as whether the resources we have in our hands are still there? Are our skills and knowledge still in our minds? It is true that this kind of real-time monitoring of one's own situation can not produce direct marginal benefits. However, this kind of monitoring itself is a good risk management method and action guide. There is a Chinese idiom with a long history. It is called "know what you know", which is probably the same meaning as this sentence. On the one hand, knowing what we know will enable us to enjoy and make full use of our resources when we have enough resources. On the other hand, when these resources show a decreasing trend or begin to deteriorate, that is, when our situation starts to get worse, we can get the signal of action and do valuable things in advance for the future Prepare for uncertainty and turn passivity into initiative. This is just like in the future Internet of things era, everything is interconnected. Although the massive data collected by numerous sensors can not produce economic value, it can combine AI algorithm to better assist us in production decision-making.

Another interesting example is in finance. As we all know, the CSRC requires listed companies to publish quarterly and annual reports. These reports, in essence, are the same as regular checks on cheese spoilage. Theoretically speaking, excluding the speculative and stochastic principles of the market, rational investors will buy more stocks when they see the key indicators (net profit, cash flow, etc.) of a listed company's financial report are better, so the stock price will also rise; if the company's revenue is in trouble, the stock of the company's probability rate will be ignored. This is essentially a kind of "keep track" thinking.

The last example is about anthropology and sociology. When we are in love, we tend to repeatedly check whether the other party still loves us. Because of the complexity of human society, we do not directly ask each other's feelings. For example, when the dwarfs check whether the cheese has deteriorated, they will not bite, but sniff first. From this point of view, this test method can also make a big difference. Then, when we find that the other person still loves us, the brain will release dopamine, oxytocin and other substances, which is the sense of reassurance and happiness mentioned above; if we find that the other party does not love ourselves so much, we need to improve or fix our relationship in various ways, and the role of inspection in this process is to determine the time of our action.

So, instead of being at a loss in the face of a sudden disaster like haw and hem, we can handle it calmly. I think the reason why haw wrote this sentence shows that he is becoming more mature and has learned from his previous experience.
