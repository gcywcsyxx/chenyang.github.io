### Welcome to My blog

#### This blog is my personal blog based on github. Below are my book review articles of the book <<Who Moved My Cheese>>.

### The main idea for the section
##### NOTICING SMALL CHANGES EARLY HELPS YOU ADAPT TO THE BIGGER CHANGES THAT ARE TO COME
Haw knew he would be better off if he had dealt with the change and left Cheese Station C sooner. He'll feel stronger physically and mentally, and he'll be better able to cope with the challenge of finding new cheese. In fact, if he had been looking forward to change instead of wasting time denying that it had happened, he might have found out by now. He used his imagination again and saw that he was looking for and tasting new cheese. He decided to continue into more unknown parts of the maze, and found bits of cheese everywhere. Haw began to regain his strength and confidence. As he reflected on where he had come from. Haw was glad that he had written on the walls in many places. He believed that if Hem chose to leave Cheese Station C, the road would become a marker for Hem to navigate the maze. Haw just hoped he was heading in the right direction.
##### MOVE WITH THE CHEESE AND ENJOY IT!
Haw forgot the past, adjusted to the present, and went on his journey. Fortunately, it wasn't long before he found his dream cheese station with lots of cheese. He also met  Sniff and Scurry. Then he wolfed down the cheese. As He enjoyed the new cheese, Haw reflected on what he had learned. He realized that while he was afraid of change, he had clung to the illusion that the old cheese no longer existed. He laughed and realized that once he learned to laugh at himself and what he had done wrong, he began to change. The quickest way to change, he realised, was to laugh at his own foolishness. He knew he had learned something useful from his mouse friends sniff and Scurry. They live a simple life. They don't overanalyze or complicate things. When the situation changed and the cheese was moved, they changed and moved with the cheese.

He knows that some fears deserve respect because they keep you from real danger. As Haw thought back to what he had learned, he thought of his friend Hem. He wondered if Hem had read what Haw had written on The walls of Cheese Station C and throughout the maze. If he found Hem, he thought he might be able to tell him how to get out of trouble. Hem had to find his way beyond comfort and fear. No one can do it for him or persuade him to do it.

Haw realized how far he had come since Hem and He had lived together at Cheese Station C. He will do what he can to avoid being shocked by unexpected changes. When Haw still had plenty of cheese, he often explored new places in the maze to stay in touch with what was going on around him. He knows it's safer to know his true choices than to isolate himself in his comfort zone. Then, unexpectedly, his companion Hem arrives...
### My personal story with regard to them


As an old Chinese saying goes, "a levee of a thousand miles breaks a nest." That's a good metaphor to what Haw just wrote on the wall. In many cases, the big crises are hidden behind the small details. As the small changes accumulates, the big crises are gradually forming. When the critical point finally reaches, the disaster happens. And we need to be good at sensing small changes in things or situations. Like Haw and Hem, if they could have noticed early on that the cheese was tapering off and never increasing, they might have been able to take some action ahead of time and take some action to avoid going without cheese.

It's like the material fatigue limit that I learned in mechanics of materials. Even steel breaks when it is bent or shaken more than a certain number of times, even if the bending is so trivial that we hardly notice it. Admittedly, the small changes mentioned in the book are very difficult to detect, but their accumulation is bound to lead to the final disaster, and the first step is to try to identify these small changes, so that we can target and prepare in advance. Maybe starve for a few days is no big deal, but what about the fracture of a costly fighter jets?

After noticing the small changes, we would be better prepared for the big ones to come. At the same time, fears will follow. However, most fears are irrational and prevent us from changing when we need to. At this point, we just need to follow the method  we mentioned before to overcome fear until we succeed.
When we finally realize our dreams, we enjoy the results happily, just like Haw. The enjoyment after success is not only a reward to ourselves, but also a kind of positive feedback. This kind of positive feedback will leave traces in our brains, and will also prompt us to think about the efforts, methods and setbacks we have experienced for this success. Perhaps, after the celebration of success, we will cherish the hard won success more, and we will learn lessons and utilize the experience in the next work.
Besides, life is short, how many times can we succeed? We should regard success as an opportunity to enjoy, just empty our minds, enjoy ourselves, and forget all negative emotions. In this way, we may be more efficient when we set out again.From this point of view, the enjoyment after success is like the rest and relaxation after a long run, which is helpful to the health and physical fitness.

In terms of personal experience, as a student, like all the students in our class, have experienced numerous examinations and interviews. These activities are very challenging and exhausting both physically and mentally. In junior high school, I once fell into a state of continuous learning, and almost no time for myself to rest and relax. At that time, I thought that time was too precious, so I could not delay a minute or a second. But the high intensity of study not only did not help me to get good grades, but also led to learning retrogression. When communicating with the teacher, he suggested that I take a rest and relax every time I finish the exam. Finally, I was no longer exhausted every day, and my grades improved with proper rest and relaxation.

I thought it would be easier after entering the university, but on the contrary, countless tasks and courses, useful or useless, hit me like a hail. I used to sleep at two o'clock every day for a period of time. Naturally, I was exhausted. A few weeks ago, the high workload reduced my immunity and caused my bronchitis. I even thought I had the coronavirus. But I can only rest in bed every day. After I got well, I planned to go to bed before 1 o'clock every night and take the initiative to set aside some time for relaxation and rest. Now, my work and rest gradually become regular, and my efficiency has improved. I realize that no one can work continuously without rest. Proper enjoyment not only does not waste time, but also improves efficiency. Just like Haw, after enjoying the cheese that he has worked hard to find, he may quickly find another one.
