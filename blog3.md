### Welcome to My blog

#### This blog is my personal blog based on github. Below are my book review articles of the book <<Who Moved My Cheese>>.


### 1.If You Do Not Change, You Can Become Extinct.

This part is mainly about the story of the two little people's reactions after they had lost the initial cheese. 
The cheese was no longer there as they return to the previous station, so they just stood there in a trance.Haw still did not want to believe the fact and he reckons that the cheese was gone all of a sudden rather than gradually getting smaller. Hem was uncertain what happened and why that happened.
When Haw mentioned whether they should make some changes, Hem was reluctant to agree, because he thought it is not reasonable for them to lose the cheese for nothing.

At the meantime, the two little mice had begun to look for new cheese in each station. As anticipated, they finally found a great supply of New Cheese.
The two little people began to accept the cruel fact and become angry and sad. When Haw thought about the two mice's successful adventure, he tended to take action. But Hem was not willling to move because of the cosy environment. As a result, they maintained what they did each day while trying to do something that may help only if miracle happens, like digging a hole. But the smart people quickly realized that it would not help to do useless jobs. They start to laugh at themselves. Eventually, they realized why and gathered their courage to set up for a new journey--To Find A New Cheese. They finally understand that change is inevitable in life and nothing is same forever.Before they leave, Haw followed his custom and wrote "If you do not change, you can become extinct."，just like the Sabretooth in the picture.

### 2.My personal story in terms of "If You Do Not Change, You Can Become Extinct."
According to Darwin's theory of evolution, the fittest survive, the unfit are eliminated, which is also the case in our lives. In fact, there are many accidents in our life, and they are in the dynamic process of constant change. Some famous people once said that in this era, the biggest constant is change! Therefore, we need to have the ability to adapt to circumstances in order to stand and develop in society. From my personal experience, I have experienced a lot of unexpected things. In fact, many things are not what you want to do. There is nothing you can do. The only thing you can do is to be well prepared, so that when changes come, you can try to adapt and reverse the profits and losses. Even if you can't achieve the expected goal, don't be anxious or sad, just make progress next time. So the first point I want to discuss in this article is that we need to be prepared for danger in times of peace and cultivate our ability to cope with changes.

Secondly, I would like to say that we also need to have a resilient heart, that is to say, when our results do not meet our expectations, we also need to look at it with a normal mind. I used to be a very depressed teenager. I was always sad for something I couldn't change, such as failing in exams and competitions. But my friend comforted me and said, "Life is very painful, it's better to be optimistic.". After that, I became more optimistic, and at the same time, I could plan my life, study and work with an ordinary mind.
