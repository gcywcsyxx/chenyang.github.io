### 1.If You Do Not Change, You Can Become Extinct.

This part is mainly about the story of the two little people's reactions after they had lost the initial cheese. 
The cheese was no longer there as they return to the previous station, so they just stood there in a trance.Haw still did not want to believe the fact and he reckons that the cheese was gone all of a sudden rather than gradually getting smaller. Hem was uncertain what happened and why that happened.
When Haw mentioned whether they should make some changes, Hem was reluctant to agree, because he thought it is not reasonable for them to lose the cheese for nothing.

At the meantime, the two little mice had begun to look for new cheese in each station. As anticipated, they finally found a great supply of New Cheese.
The two little people began to accept the cruel fact and become angry and sad. When Haw thought about the two mice's successful adventure, he tended to take action. But Hem was not willling to move because of the cosy environment. As a result, they maintained what they did each day while trying to do something that may help only if miracle happens, like digging a hole. But the smart people quickly realized that it would not help to do useless jobs. They start to laugh at themselves. Eventually, they realized why and gathered their courage to set up for a new journey--To Find A New Cheese. They finally understand that change is inevitable in life and nothing is same forever.Before they leave, Haw followed his custom and wrote "If you do not change, you can become extinct."

#### Response#1：What does this section say?
As the mice and little people enjoyed their cheese day by day, the quantity of it was gradually declining.However,they take different actions while constantly consuming the cheese.
The two people, on the one hand, took it for granted that they deserved the cheese and this arrogance made them become dependent on the cheese. On the other hand, the two mice still kept their habit and kept track of the change as time goes.

Finally, the worst thing came that one day, the cheese vanished. as Sniff and Scurry were aware of the fact that the cheese was getting smaller, they were not surprised at all and began their journey to search new cheese in the maze, in a way that is primitive and wild.
On the contrary, for Haw and Hem, this news is devastating. Both of them are very sad and anxious. Haw is unable to believe this. As for him, the cheese stands for safety and comfort. Hem become out of control and begin yelling, as the cheese means power to him.

#### Response#2:What does this section mean for me?
In my opinion, the cheese can be resource that you treasure or need. However, these resources are not evitable and forever last. For consumer goods, when we enjoy them, they are fewer; for the resources and property you control, you may lose them because of some uncontrollable factors. This requires us to be prepared in time of safety, to deal with all unexpected or doomed things. 
On the macro level, this epidemic is a good example. We can't communicate with foreign teachers face-to-face. We can only communicate through Tencent meetings. Some business owners are bankrupt because they have no orders. This requires these companies to keep a healthy balance sheet before the epidemic. As for my own experience, I once got IELTS 7.5 in high school, which is a very high score, and the level is basically equivalent to that of native English speakers. However, this result will be invalid in December this year for the certificate can only last for two years. At the same time, my English level is also declining, which requires me to practice English. On the one hand, I need to develop new advantages for myself and learn more things on the other hand. It's a painful process because I have to repeat what I used to be very good at, but I have no other choice. In short, it is very important to be alert to danger in times of safety. We need to consider the possible risks in our comfort and be prepared in advance.
