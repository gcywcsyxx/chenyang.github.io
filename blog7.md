### Welcome to My blog

#### This blog is my personal blog based on github. Below are my book review articles of the book <<Who Moved My Cheese>>.
Due to the tight schedule, from today on, my weekly blog will include two sections

### The main idea for the section
##### WHEN YOU STOP BEING AFRAID, YOU FEEL GOOD! 
Haw walked out of the dark corridor and began to feel his fear, but as time went on, he realized that fear would only worsen the situation, so he began to stop the fear and move on. He miraculously discovered that it was great to stop being afraid.

##### IMAGINING YOURSELF ENJOYING YOUR NEW CHEESE LEADS YOU TO IT
Haw took a deep breath and felt energetic. He began to sketch beautiful and concrete pictures in his mind again. This imagination gradually turned into positive psychological hints, which gave him the motivation and passion to find cheese.


### My personal story with regard to them
##### 1. Stop being afraid feels great!
We are always faced with all kinds of tasks, burdens and difficulties in our life, which always make us exhausted, anxious and even full of fear every day. When the overall social and economic downturn, especially the spread of the new epidemic in the world today, the whole society is full of fear, fear of unemployment, or fear of health threat. But, as I mentioned before, the most frightening thing is fear itself, which does not improve the situation, but makes it worse, because they inhibit the improvement of results subconsciously.

If we can stop our fear and relax our mind, we will be in a good mood. And this kind of happy mood also brings good health, this kind of health will help you to retain vitality in the most difficult time; when the haze is over, you can spread your wings and soar into the sky. So if you're at a loss because of a certain job, you're afraid that you may fail an exam, or you're worried that someone you love will betray you, stop your fear and stay happy. Why not?



##### 2. Metaphorically speaking,"fake it till you make it"
I have heard the saying "Fake it till it make it". Let's leave aside the moral impropriety of this statement for a moment, in fact, it fits this section perfectly. The essence of this statement is that positive mental cues can boost you so much that you may be able to accomplish something you weren't able to.

In fact, many of the greatest achievements in history have been achieved without first believing. Just as in this section Haw began to draw beautiful blueprints in his mind, many great scientific and technological breakthroughs depend on scientists or engineers being the first to believe in the realization of science. Elon Musk, a famous American entrepreneur, started his own research and development of recoverable rockets in spite of the opposition of most "experts". Today, spaceX has mastered the world's most advanced recoverable rocket technology. At that time, although he lacked funds, technology, talent people, he firmly believed that the recoverable rocket will be realized, after years of efforts, this vision has become a reality. Now, he also imagines that one day he will be able to immigrate to Mars. I believe that he has very detailed planning and imagination in his mind. I hope that his dream can come true, so does Haw.
