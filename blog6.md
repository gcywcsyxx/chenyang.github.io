### Welcome to My blog

#### This blog is my personal blog based on github. Below are my book review articles of the book <<Who Moved My Cheese>>.


### 1.Movement In A New Direction Helps You Find New Cheese.
After searching for cheese for quite a long time, Haw eventually discovered a big station that looked like promising but actually vacant inside. Because he had had such feeling a lot of times, he became a little impatient and felt like giving up again.He began to want to go back to station C with hem.

In fact, he is not sure whether he is afraid, perhaps he is afraid of walking alone. But he recalled that the best time he felt was when he was walking alone.

### 2.My personal story with regard to "Movement In A New Direction Helps You Find New Cheese."
This part is also relatively short, but also contains the rich emotions of haw. I think this section gives me some inspirations and insights: 
#### 1. Things will not always develop as you think. Just like haw's experience, cheese can't be found immediately if you want to find it, even if you have tried to find it for a long time. 
#### 2. After many setbacks, you may fall into despair and think of giving up and returning to the previous life 
#### 3. Even in despair, don't stop, because if you keep going and keep looking for new opportunities, you will get closer and closer to your goal. If you stop or regress, it will do harm to you. 
#### 4. In order to meet the third point, when we encounter difficulties in life, we must train our hearts to make them stronger and not afraid of difficulties and setbacks, so as to maintain the state of progress.
