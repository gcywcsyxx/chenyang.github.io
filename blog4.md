### Welcome to My blog

#### This blog is my personal blog based on github. Below are my book review articles of the book <<Who Moved My Cheese>>.


### 1.What would you do if you weren't afraid?

This section is very short, only a dozen lines, the main content is the psychological changes of haw. First of all, when haw was just about to enter the maze, he thought about not finding the cheese, and these fears were keeping him from acting. He looked at the comfortable cheese station and fell into self doubt and hesitation.

### 2.My personal story in terms of "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"

Franklin D. Roosevelt once said:"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself". Many times, when we have not done something, we have already begun to fear the difficulty of things; or when we are ready to change the environment, we will unconsciously nostalgia for the previous comfortable environment.
These worries and anxieties are completely unnecessary and toxic. It's true that what we're going to do may be very difficult, but these anxieties can turn into negative psychological cues that affect our performance and the outcome of things.I have been affected by these emotions before, but as I become more mature, I began to learn to adjust my emotions and let them help me win.

From middle school until entering university, I was always anxious. I can't tell the specific reason. The symptom is that there is something waiting for me all the time. I have to finish the present thing as soon as possible, but there is nothing urgent behind it. Do anything will be very anxious, but finished, and then into the next round of anxious state. Most of the time, I'm in a hurry and can't slow down, so the efficiency is very low, because there is no rhythm at all. It seems that I just want to make my schedule full. These times, the heart is like a big stone, very uncomfortable. Later, I was lucky to read Dale Carnegie's stop worrying and start living, and I was relieved from this state of anxiety. This book is a part of "human weakness".  There are a lot of videos and courses on the Internet to deal with anxiety.
In fact，the anxiety helps too. It may optimize your decision and make your steps safer.
So in a nutshell, just think of ways to eliminate the anxiety or let the anxiety to help you act. Finally when the emotion is well regulated, just do it! Only in this way are you closer to the goal.
